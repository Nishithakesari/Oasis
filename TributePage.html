                    <li>
                        Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.His ancestors had 
                        been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. 
                        Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from 
                        Arab traders and local women. The family business had involved trading groceries between the mainland
                         and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and 
                         Pamban. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses 
                         failed and the family fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home. 
                         The family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy he had to sell 
                         newspapers to add to the family's meager income.

                        While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of 
                        progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next 
                        three days.
